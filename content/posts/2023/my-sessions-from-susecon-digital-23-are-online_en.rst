I had the great opportunity to speak at SUSECON 23, live in Munich and at the digital conference, about 
*Rancher integration with AWS services* and *SUSE ALP prototype on AWS, experimental, but fun!*. The 
recordings from SUSECON Digital are online, if you missed them, you can still watch them, 
you only need to register (for free) to access the portal and to start the replay.

[TUT-1179] SUSE ALP prototype on AWS: Experimental, but fun!
------------------------------------------------------------

What is Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP), the next generation Linux operating system? Want to learn how to run 
the latest prototype on AWS? What is required to build a EC2-compatible image via the Open Build Service (OBS)? 
What does the workflow look like to go from OBS to an available and deployable AMI? What is the state of 
integration with AWS compared to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server? Let me take you on my journey and share my 
experiences, thoughts and results with you.

[PROD-1178] Rancher integration with AWS services: possibilities, challenges & outlook
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rancher can deploy and manage your Kubernetes clusters on AWS EKS and EC2, but what about things like 
authentication, logging, monitoring or backup? I will give an overview of AWS services for these four 
pillars and talk about what's already possible, which challenges some integrations might have and an 
outlook on what is planned. Learn more about how the integrations are working under the hood and 
which technologies are involved.
