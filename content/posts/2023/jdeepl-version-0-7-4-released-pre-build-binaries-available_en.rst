It's been a while since I announced and released the first version of
`jDeepL - Unofficial DeepL App for Linux based on JavaFX <{filename}/posts/2022/jdeepl_unofficial_deepl_app_for_linux_based_on_javafx_en.rst>`_.
Since then it was mentioned on a couple of news sites and people reached out to me.
Mostly with pointing out that there are not much instructions how to build it.
And that I don't offer pre-build binaries that people can directly run.

That was good and valid feedback. I was focused on sharing it with the world.
I didn't take into account that non-tech people are the actual users.

As part of the recent
`Git repos moved to Sourcehut, with mirrors on Codeberg, GitLab and GitHub <{filename}/posts/2023/git-repos-moved-to-sourcehut-with-mirrors-on-codeberg-gitlab-and-github_en.rst>`_
activities, I allocated a bit of time to tackle some of the addressed issues.
The `README <https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/jDeepL>`_ should now be a bit clearer.
I updated some dependencies, improved the release scripts and published
`v0.7.4 <https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/jDeepL/commit/a0801cbde9f606aa4a23fe459c5682b7c68ed799>`_.

For the future I plan a CI integration that takes care about publishing new versions.
Until then, I uploaded the pre-build version to  my personal Nextcloud instance: https://hub.xlii.cc/s/an7E9E9bgFBpRG3

Latest version: v0.7.4 (SHA256 checksum: 206c13ec820451096bdf07f29e336c6827c750db11554d9dcc68812c8b56c796)

It's nice to see that some people find useful what I created.
