I had the great opportunity to speak at `openSUSE Conference 23 <https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23>`_ in Nuremberg about 
`Rancher integration with AWS services: possibilities, challenges, outlook <https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23/program/proposals/4169>`_ and 
`openSUSE ALP prototype on AWS, experimental, but fun! <https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSC23/program/proposals/4163>`_, the recordings are now online.

openSUSE ALP prototype on AWS, experimental, but fun!
-----------------------------------------------------

How does the latest prototype of the Adaptable Linux Platform behave on AWS? What is required to build 
a EC2 compatible image via OBS? How does the workflow look like to go from OBS to an available and 
deployable AMI? What is the state of integration with AWS compared to openSUSE Leap? And what has 
SUSE NeuVector todo with all that? Let me take you on my journey and share my experiences, 
thoughts and results with you.

Rancher integration with AWS services: possibilities, challenges, outlook.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rancher can deploy and manage your Kubernetes clusters on AWS EKS and EC2. But what about things like 
Authentication, Logging, Monitoring or Backup? I will give an overview of AWS services for these four 
pillars and talk about what’s already possible, which challenges some integrations might have and an 
outlook what’s planned. Learn more about how the integrations are working under the hood and which 
technologies and open-sources solutions are involved.
