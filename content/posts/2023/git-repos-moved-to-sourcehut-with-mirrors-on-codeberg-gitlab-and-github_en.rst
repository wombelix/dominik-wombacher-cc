When I `moved from a VPC to classic webhosting <{filename}/posts/2023/website-migration-and-temporary-shutdown-of-onion-service_en.rst>`_ 
I had to shutdown my self-hosted git repos as well. I had `Sourcehut <https://sourcehut.org>`_ on my list for years and decided it's finally 
time to test it. If you are used to (bloated) platforms like GitHub or GitLab, then Sourcehut is kind of shocking, in a positive way. 
Pure HTML, no JavaScript, every feature (git repos, docs, build service, wiki ect.) is a widely independent micro-service with it's own subdomain.

I really liked it and decided to go with a paid account, right now `sr.ht <https://sr.ht>`_ is in alpha state and payment is optional. 
But alone the very nice build system and a fast loading page without tracking is more than worth it!

From now on, `~git/ <https://dominik.wombacher.cc/~git/>`_ redirects to `git.sr.ht/~wombelix/ <https://git.sr.ht/~wombelix/>`_, for 
better visibility, I decided to also mirror to `codeberg.org/wombelix <https://codeberg.org/wombelix>`_, 
`gitlab.com/wombelix <https://gitlab.com/wombelix>`_ and `github.com/wombelix <https://github.com/wombelix>`_.

I don't want to force someone to follow a specific process or be limited to a single platform, if you like my projects 
and want to contribute, use whatever site and workflow you prefer to create an issue or pull/merge-request, or send me a good old Email :).

If I should create a list or tracker on sr.ht and have a preferred process one day, 
I will add it to the README and/or CONTRIBUTE file in my projects.
