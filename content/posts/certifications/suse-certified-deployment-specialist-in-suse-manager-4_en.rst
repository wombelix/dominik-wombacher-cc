By passing the Exam and getting recognized as **SCDS in SUSE Manager 4** today, my SUSE Training & Certification Month comes to an end. 
I didn't planned to take this one in September but I had such a good run and couldn't resist.

**Summary**: Knowledge of the various architectural components of a SUSE Manager, installation and post-installation 
configuration process for SUSE Manager Servers and SUSE Manager Proxy Servers, a detailed understanding of the various 
methods that can be used to on-board target servers as managed Salt Minions and an understanding of how to provide 
a well-managed and controlled approach to system patching and system updating.
