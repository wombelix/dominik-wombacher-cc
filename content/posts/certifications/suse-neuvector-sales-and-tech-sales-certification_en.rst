Everyone is talking about SUSE NeuVector, I though it's time to learn more 
about it so I took the Sales and Technical Sales Course and passed the Exam.

To get a first Overview about features and functionality, 
that's always a good starting point.

I have to admit, I was impressed about the NeuVector approach to work on 
the Network Layer and use those data as source of truth.

That's extremely different as anything else I saw in that area yet, can't wait 
to roll it out in my Kubernetes Clusters.
