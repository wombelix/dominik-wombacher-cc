I was invited to the Beta Exam and passed the **SCDS in SUSE Edge** today.
The Solution is basically a compilation of different Products.
Most notable is the Edge Image Builder (EIB), the Exam asks a lot about it.
Which makes sense, that's really unique to the Edge Solution and heavily
covered in the Training Course.

**Summary**: The SUSE Certified Deployment Specialist (SCDS) in SUSE EDGE
is designed for IT professionals or infrastructure professionals responsible
for configuring Edge Image Builder to create image files to be used to deploy
SUSE Edge management and downstream clusters with. This certification validates
a person's knowledge and understanding of how to create output image files to
boot the cluster nodes from, as well as the deployment methods available for
deploying SUSE Edge downstream clusters using Standalone, Phone Home, or
Directed network provisioning methods.
