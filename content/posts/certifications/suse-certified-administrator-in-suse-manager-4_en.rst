I passed the SUSE Exam *sca_suma4* today and refreshed my `SCA Systems Management / SUSE Manager 3 <{filename}suse-certified-administrator-in-systems-management-suse-manager-3_en.rst>`_ Certification to SUSE Manager 4. Was very interesting to validate existing knowledge and as always, even though I use SUSE Manager 4 regularly, there is always something new to learn!

**Summary**: Fundamental knowledge of SUSE Manager, including using the Web UI management console, implementing channel management, delegating management authority, managing minions using Salt and perform other day to day administrative tasks using SUSE Manager 4.
