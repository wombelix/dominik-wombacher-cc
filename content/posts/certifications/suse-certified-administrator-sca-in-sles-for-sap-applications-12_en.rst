September was somehow my *SUSE Learning month*, first I 
`Updated my SCA and SCE to SLE 15 <{filename}/posts/certifications/suse-certified-sca-and-sce-in-enterprise-linux-15_en.rst>`_, 
followed by earning `SCA SLE HA 12 & 15 <{filename}/posts/certifications/suse-certified-administrator-sca-in-suse-linux-enterprise-high-availability-12-and-15_en.rst>`_ 
and today I also became a **SCA+ in SLES for SAP Applications 12**!

I very proud about that huge learning progress and the successful certifications in September, 
they helped me to brush up some knowledge and prepare for my new gig in October.

**Summary**: "SCA+ in SLES for SAP Applications 12" is for administrators who are managing 
SLES instances as the platform for SAP deployments. With a focus on specific functionality 
provided by SLES for SAP including SLES High Availability as well as components specific to
