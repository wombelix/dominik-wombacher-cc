I was invited to the Beta Exam and passed the **SCDS in SUSE Multi-Linux Manager** today.
SUSE decided to create a new Certification for SUSE Multi-Linux Manager 5,
formerly SUSE Manager. I'm not sure if I agree that the difference are that
large already to justify a new Certification Exam. But it isn't my call to make.
SMLM5 - SUMA5 would still sound nicer - runs in a large monolithic container.
So a couple of new CLI tools were introduced to abstract some of the management
tasks related to the new deployment method. Besides that, there aren't much
differences to SUSE Manager 4, at least not which would be relevant for this Exam.

**Summary**: The SUSE Certified Deployment Specialist (SCDS) in SUSE Multi-Linux
Manager is designed for professionals responsible for the deployment and
configuration of SUSE Multi-Linux Manager.  This certification demonstrates
knowledge of the SUSE Multi-Linux Manager architecture and the ability to
install and configure its core components, including the Manager Server
and Proxy Server.
