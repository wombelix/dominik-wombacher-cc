I started my Public Cloud / Hyperscaler Journey with Azure, first stop: AZ-900 Exam, passed and Certification received. 
Up next: AZ-104 - Microsoft Azure Administrator. AWS will follow in near future, I also plan run some Side Projects on Azure and AWS.

**Update** There are a lot of great and mostly even free resources out their to prepare for the AZ-900, my favorites:

- `Microsoft Learning, AZ-900 Exam Overview <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900>`_, Scroll down to *"Items in this collection"* to access the related learning paths.

- `John Savill's Technical Training, AZ-900 Certification Course <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nED0_vMEniWBQjSoxTsBYS3>`_

And if your Employer is part of the `Microsoft Enterprise Skills Initiative <https://esi.microsoft.com>`_, use the offered Practice Exams as final step before taking the exam.

**Summary**: Earners of the Azure Fundamentals certification have demonstrated foundational level knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure.
