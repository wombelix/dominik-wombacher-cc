Third day at SUSECON 23 in Munich, third Exam passed: **SCDS in Rancher Manager 2.7 for Rancher Prime**.
After passing `SCA in NeuVector 5 <{filename}/posts/certifications/suse-certified-administrator-in-suse-neuvector-5_en.rst>`_
and `SCDS in Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 <{filename}/posts/certifications/suse-certified-deployment-specialist-in-rancher-kubernetes-engine-2_en.rst>`_
already during SUSECON, I can remove the last SUSE certification from my list.

In addition to my talk about **Rancher integrations with AWS services** and my presence at the AWS booth,
I would say the three days at SUSECON were very productive and successful for me this year :)

**Summary**: Thorough understanding in deploying, backing up, restoring, and upgrading Rancher Manager
in a professional setting.
