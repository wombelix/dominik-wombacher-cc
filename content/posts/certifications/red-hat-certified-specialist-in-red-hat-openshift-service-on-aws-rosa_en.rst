It was time to re-new and keep my  `RHCSA <{filename}red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhel-8_en.rst>`_,
and `RHCE <{filename}red-hat-certified-engineer-ansible-28-rhel-8_en.rst>`_ current.
I was curious about the recently released RHCS in ROSA Exam. I passed the EX229 today and earned the
`Red Hat Certified Specialist in Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) <https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/red-hat-certified-specialist-rosa>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20240915110026/https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/red-hat-certified-specialist-rosa>`__,

Certification!

It was kind of a logical choice to take this one. Fits pretty well into my current Role,
tech focus and complements previously gained skills.

It wasn't my first Red Hat Exam but I can tell, it was one of the most challenging one.
I used the Red Hat Courses DO120, DO280, CS220 and CS221 to prepare.
AWS and Kubernetes Hands-On experience helps a lot.
Also the muscle memory from last years
`CKAD <{filename}ckad-certified-kubernetes-application-developer_en.rst>`_,
`CKA <{filename}cka-certified-kubernetes-administrator_en.rst>`_ and
`CKS <{filename}cks-certified-kubernetes-security-specialist_en.rst>`_ marathon.
I don't think I would've passed otherwise.

You have 3 hours to finish the exam, which sounds long but the time is just flying by.
You need to be fast and 100% focused. Makes me even more proud that I aced it :D

**Summary**: A Red Hat Certified Specialist in ROSA is able to configure and manage Red Hat OpenShift clusters running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The credential is earned after successfully passing the Red Hat Certified Specialist in ROSA (EX229).
