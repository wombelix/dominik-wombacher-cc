Today I earned the **Red Hat Certified Engineer** Certification by passing the Red Hat Exam *EX294*.

It's the Version 8 RHCE Exam which quite differ from the "old" one by focussing on Ansible.

So during the performance-based Exam you have to create a lot of Ansible Playbooks and Roles to solve the Tasks. It's a tough Exam but fair and preparing for it improved my Ansible Skills a lot, even though I was using Ansible quite often within the last years.

**Summary**: A Red Hat速 Certified Engineer (RHCE速) is a Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) who is ready to automate Red Hat速 Enterprise Linux速 tasks, integrate Red Hat emerging technologies, and apply learned automation skills for efficiency and innovation.
