It's been a while since I tackled the `RHCSA <{filename}red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhel-8_en.rst>`_, 
`RHCE <{filename}red-hat-certified-engineer-ansible-28-rhel-8_en.rst>`_ followed by the 
`RHCS (Ansible Best Practices) <{filename}red-hat-certified-specialist-in-advanced-automation-ansible-best-practices-ansible-28-tower-35-rhel-8_en.rst>`_, 
but today I passed the EX342 and earned the 'Red Hat Certified Specialist in Linux Diagnostics and Troubleshooting' Certification!

That's already my second Certification counting towards the Red Hat Architect, let's see if that's something I can achieve within the next year :)

The Exam is still based on RHEL 7, what's probably fine because most of the Topics and Tasks would be more or less identical on RHEL 8. 
Was the hardest Red Hat Exam I attended so far, I studied with the RH342 eBook from my earlier RHLS and the Course from A Cloud Guru.

The ACG Course was okay but in my opinion didn't covered the Topics in the necessary depth, I don't think I could pass the Exam with ACG only. 
The original Red Hat eBook in combination with existing knowledge and the Hands-On Labs from ACG was a good mix and preparation.

But due to the fact that the "new" RHCE is focusing on Ansible, I can only recommend to prepare additionally with the RHCE RHEL 7 Content!

**Summary**: A Red Hat Certified Specialist in Linux Diagnostics and Troubleshooting is capable to prevent costly downtime due to system failure and quickly recover failed systems using analysis, diagnosis, and troubleshooting.
