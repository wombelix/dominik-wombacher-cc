Passed the **GitHub Foundations** certification exam today. I've been using Git and GitHub for years, but figured it was time to make it official and validate my understanding of the foundational concepts.

The exam covers the basics like repositories, commits, branching, markdown, and project management, but also dives into collaboration features and modern development workflows. Since I work with GitHub almost daily, most of the content was familiar, but it's always good to ensure you're following best practices and not missing any useful features.

GitHub Actions was probably the area where I learned the most during preparation - while I've used it before, the exam really covers the CI/CD pipeline aspects in detail.

**Summary**: Passing the GitHub Foundations certification exam validates subject matter expertise by measuring entry-level skills with GitHub basics like repositories, commits, branching, markdowns, and project management.
