Never stop learning! Today I passed the Exam **SUSE Certified Deployment Specialist in SUSE Rancher and Kubernetes Distributions**, 
it's my second SUSE Rancher and Kubernetes related Certification, preparing for the Exam helped me to get an in-depth understanding 
of deploying and configuring various Rancher Kubernetes Distributions (RKE, RKE2, K3s), great extension to the 
**SCA SUSE Rancher 2.6** I received a few days ago.

**Summary**: Knowledge how to deploy Kubernetes clusters with RKE, RKE2 and K3S, both from the command line and 
from SUSE Rancher as well as how to deploy Rancher on Kubernetes, also how to backup and restore 
RKE and RKE2 clusters from the command line and back up RKE with SUSE Rancher.
