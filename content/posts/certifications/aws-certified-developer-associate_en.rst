Continuing my AWS Journey and on my way to get the Associate Trifecta, I passed the AWS Certified Developer - Associate 
Exam today, **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate** up next.

During my `AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate <{filename}/posts/certifications/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate_en.rst>`_ 
preparation, I wasted too much time with *"the wrong"* training resources. This time I just used the 
`eBook <https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/tutorials-dojo-study-guide-ebook-aws-certified-developer-associate/>`_ 
and `Practice Exam <https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams/>`_ 
from Tutorials Dojo. The content overlap between the Solutions Architect and Developer Exam is in my opinion around 60%, 
also a lot of concepts are not specific to AWS but about development in general, so no need to enter the tutorial hell 
and learn the same things over and over again ;) 

Summary
*********

Earners of this certification have a comprehensive understanding of application life-cycle management. 
They demonstrated proficiency in writing applications with AWS service APIs, AWS CLI, and SDKs; 
using containers; and deploying with a CI/CD pipeline. Badge owners are able to develop, deploy, 
and debug cloud-based applications that follow AWS best practices.
