And the next one, after passing the `CKA <{filename}/posts/certifications/cka-certified-kubernetes-administrator_en.rst>`_ 
a week ago, I cleared **CKAD: Certified Kubernetes Application Developer** today, which makes two out of three, next stop CKS!

I wrote a bit about the experience with PSI already last week in the CKA Post, it was very similar this week, swift check-in process, 
quite relaxed proctor, no real technical issues with the exam environment, my setup was exactly the same.

From an Exam perspective it was really cool to dive deep into different deployment scenarios, how to configure and troubleshoot them, 
gave me even more confidence with Kubernetes and using :code:`kubectl`. In hindsight, it would've probably better to take the CKAD *before* 
the CKA Exam. Now that I know what's covered and how the Exams are, that feels like a more logical order, CKAD is overall a little easier as CKA.

It was again performance-based, as all Kubernetes Exam from The Linux Foundation, and I can't get enough of it. This type of exam is just so 
much more fun, engaging and challenging as question-based ones. From that perspective I'm a little sad that I only have one other Exam ahead.

I'm now going to prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS), after all I heard, that's a complete different beast compared to 
CKA and CKAD. Let's see if I can make it in two weeks and how different it really will be.

**Summary**: Earners of this designation demonstrated the skills, knowledge and competencies to perform the responsibilities of a 
Kubernetes Application Developer. Earners are able to define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor, 
and troubleshoot scalable applications and tools in Kubernetes. The skills and knowledge demonstrated by earners include Core 
Concepts, Configuration, Multi-Container Pods, Observability, Pod Design, Services & Networking, State Persistence.
