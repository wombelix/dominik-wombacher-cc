First day at SUSECON 23 in Munich, first Exam passed: **SCA in SUSE NeuVector 5**. 
During SUSECON, event attendees can take SUSE Exams live on-site, I still had three on my Bucket list and 
prepared for all of them during the last weeks. Today I can remove the *SCA in SUSE NeuVector 5* from the list, 
I will try the *SCDS in Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2* tomorrow and *SCDS in Rancher Manager 2.7 for Rancher Prime* 
the day after, fingers crossed.

**Summary**: Fundamental knowledge of using SUSE NeuVector Management Console and command line utilities to 
perform administrative tasks after the actual SUSE NeuVector 5 deployment. Configuration and management 
tasks included are for example scanning images and compliance, as well as managing runtime security for 
containerized applications. Runtime security provides real time security management for processes, 
files, and network traffic.
