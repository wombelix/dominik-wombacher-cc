I passed the Red Hat Exam *EX200* today and received my **Red Hat Certified System Administrator** Certification.

What I really like and what makes the difference is the fact that all Red Hat Exams are performance-based.

That means, you get access to a virtual environment during your Exam and have to perform real-world tasks. There are no Multiple Choice Questions, you actually have to configure those System accordingly. SUSE did something similiar in the Past but change recently to question-based Exams.

**Summary**: An IT professional who has earned the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSAÂ®) is able to perform the core system administration skills required in Red Hat Enterprise Linux environments. The credential is earned after successfully passing the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) Exam (EX200).
