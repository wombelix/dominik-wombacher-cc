SUSE invited me as Beta tester for the new **SUSE Certified Deployment Specialist in SLES High-Availability 15** Exam.
It was my pleasure to provide feedback and help to improve the Exam. Nice side effect that I also passed :)
One more to go before I'm back at 100% SUSE certified ;)

Preparation was as usual, I mainly used the official SUSE Lecture and Lab Guide.
I like to read them on my tablet at the evening and find that more convenient than watching videos.

**Summary**:

Demonstrates knowledge of how to plan the deployment of an HA cluster,
deploy the cluster and perform post deployment configuration and testing.
