Cloud here I come, didn't planned to take the AWS Practitioner so quickly after the Azure Fundamentals, but I was so curious about things that both might have in common as well as the differences, that I couldn't resist. Exam passed and now I'm a proud "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner" :)

I prepared for this Exam with the great resources Amazon offers (for free) on `AWS Skill Builder <https://explore.skillbuilder.aws>`_:

- `Cloud Essential Learning Plan <https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/lp/82/cloud-essentials-learning-plan>`_

- `AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner <https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/11458/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner>`_

-  `Exam Prep: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner <https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/9449/exam-prep-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner>`_

- `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Official Practice Question Set (CLF-01 - English) <https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/12483/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-official-practice-question-set-clf-c01-english>`_

Compared to the `Azure Fundamentals <{filename}/posts/certifications/microsoft-certified-azure-fundamentals_en.rst>`_ some deeper understanding about technical aspects was required to pass the Exam. So it's in my opinion definitely worth it and a good starting point, makes further studying for an Associate Certification definitely easier.

**Summary**: Earners of this certification have a fundamental understanding of IT services and their uses in the AWS Cloud. They demonstrated cloud fluency and foundational AWS knowledge. Badge owners are able to identify essential AWS services necessary to set up AWS-focused projects.
