I did it, after already passing `CKA <{filename}/posts/certifications/cka-certified-kubernetes-administrator_en.rst>`_ 
and `CKAD <{filename}/posts/certifications/ckad-certified-kubernetes-application-developer_en.rst>`_, I completed the trifecta 
today by passing the **CKS: Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist** as well. Taking and passing all three within one Month was 
challenging, at some point a little stressful, but very rewarding and satisfying!

As mentioned in the `CKA <{filename}/posts/certifications/cka-certified-kubernetes-administrator_en.rst>`_ 
and `CKAD <{filename}/posts/certifications/ckad-certified-kubernetes-application-developer_en.rst>`_, post already, 
no real problems with PSI, everything went quite smooth again, nothing to complain about.

The Exam was, as expected, on a whole other level compared to CKA and CKAD. The requirement to take the CKS is to hold an active 
CKA, which you going to need. All the additional knowledge you have to gain about various security tools and best-practices is massive. 
But also extremely valuable, preparing for the Exam and diving deep into Kubernetes security made me realize how many attack vectors are 
out there I wasn't even thinking of so far. For me it was an eye opener and I'm glad I decided to tackle all three exams, I learned 
more in a month as I did on my own within the last year.

I took some Red Hat Exams in 2021 and loved the fact that they are also performance-based, I'm three specialist certifications short 
to become a Red Hat Certified Architect, so I guess some Red Hat OpenShift Certifications are next on my list :)

**Summary**: Earners of this designation are accomplished Kubernetes practitioners (as evidenced by holding the CKA credential). 
Earners demonstrated the requisite abilities to secure container-based applications and Kubernetes platforms during build, 
deployment and runtime, and are qualified to perform these tasks in a professional setting.
