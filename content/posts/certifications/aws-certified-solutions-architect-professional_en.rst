Just one week after the `AWS DevOps Engineer Professional <{filename}/posts/certifications/aws-certified-devops-engineer-professional_en.rst>`_
I also passed the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional** exam.
I prefer to take such exams close to each other. There is always some overlap
in content and concepts. Also, when I'm already in study mode it's
easier for me to continue. Long breaks just kill momentum.

Again, `Tutorials Dojo <https://www.tutorialsdojo.com>`_ was my
resource of choice for the necessary study material.

The Exam prep was a bit dryer compared to the DevOps Pro.
The SA role isn't only about tech and in general pretty broad.
So even though you don't have to know individual topics in-depth and
with every detail, you need to learn about a broad set of services
and best practices to put them together to a useful solution.

It was still very valuable and in combination with DevOps Pro it
pushed my understanding and confidence about AWS services.
