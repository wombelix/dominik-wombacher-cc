Here comes another one, **SCDS in SUSE NeuVector 5** cleared today.
It's my third SUSE Enterprise Container Management related Certification, the first one in the Security field.
As always, preparing for an Exam is my motivation to dive deep and to learn more about a specific topic,
I could learn without an attached Exam, but I have to admit, it would be harder for me to stay on course and reach my goal.

In my current Job I work closely with SUSE to further improve the customer experience of Rancher and NeuVector on AWS,
investing time to improve my skills and learn as much as possible about the solutions is a logical step and I enjoy it.

**Summary**: Knowledge and understanding of the various deployment methods of SUSE NeuVector, including the use of YAML files,
Helm Charts, and Config Map settings, both during and after deployment.
