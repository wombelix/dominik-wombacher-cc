I took and passed the brand new
`Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certified AI Practitioner <https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20240915110657/https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/>`__,

exam this morning!
Pretty cool to be one of the first people certified.
I even got this nice Early Adopter Badge :D

I'm already 6 times AWS Certified (1x Practitioner, 3x Associate, 2x Pro)
but also wanted to gain a better understanding of AI and ML on AWS.
Preparing and taking the AI Practitioner Exam was very valuable for me.
I would do it again and recommend it to others to gain a solid understanding.

It's a very new Exam, at the time I took it even in Beta state.
The amount of available training content is low.
I used a combination of the official Learning Path available in AWS SkillBuilder
and the Course from Stephane Mareek. That worked out well thanks to previous
AWS Certifications and a lot of practical knowledge as part of my current Role.

**Summary**: Earners of this badge understand AI, ML, and generative AI concepts, methods, and strategies in general and on AWS.
They can determine the correct types of AI/ML technologies to apply to specific use cases and know how to use AI, ML, and
generative AI technologies responsibly. They are familiar with the AWS Global Infrastructure, core AWS services and use
cases, AWS service pricing models, and the AWS shared responsibility model for security and compliance in the AWS Cloud.
