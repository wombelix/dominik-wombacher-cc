I passed the new **SUSE Certified Administrator (SCA) in Longhorn 1.5**  Exam today!
Finally back at 100% SUSE Certified after almost a month since it was released ;)
Now I'm waiting for the SUSE Training Team to create and publish a new Tech Exam :)

I used the official SUSE Course
`Longhorn Deployment and Operations - LHN201v1.5 <https://www.suse.com/training/course/lhn201/>`_
to prepare and found it sufficient. A couple of questions were a bit tricky from
a wording perspective and not well reflected in the Course content.
But the majority was of questions was well structured and balanced.

Never heard of Longhorn before?
It's SUSEs *Cloud native distributed block storage for Kubernetes*,
to learn more visit: https://longhorn.io

PS: Yeah, I know, *Longhorn* was also the codename for an
operating system that spectacularly failed many many years ago ;)

**Summary**: This certification validates fundamental knowledge of Longhorn, including installation, configuration,
management, and troubleshooting of Longhorn clusters. It tests the candidate's ability to utilize Longhorn's features
such as automated backups, disaster recovery, and volume snapshots to ensure high availability and data protection in
Kubernetes environments.
