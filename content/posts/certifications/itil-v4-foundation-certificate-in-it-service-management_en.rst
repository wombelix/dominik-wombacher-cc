After attending to a AXELOS Accredited Training Course and passing the Exam, 
I earned my **ITIL v4 Foundation** Certification.

**Summary**: The ITIL 4 Foundation certification is designed as an introduction 
to ITIL 4 and enables candidates to look at IT service management through an 
end-to-end operating model for the creation, delivery and continual improvement 
of tech-enabled products and services.
