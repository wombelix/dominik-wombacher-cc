Back at 100% after passing **SCDS in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15** today.
Right now, I'm holding all available SUSE Certifications, a milestone I reached
the first time in November 2022. I'm proud about it and plan to keep up with whatever
Certification SUSE is going to release next :)

This one was also very special for me because SUSE invited me as BETA tester
for the Exam and I had the opportunity to provide feedback, which was used to further
improve the questions and answers before the official release at SUSECON 23 in Munich.

**Summary**: Knowledge and understanding of various deployment methods and techniques,
including manual deployment, automated installation using AutoYaST, image-based
deployment using KIWI and deployment on public cloud platforms.
