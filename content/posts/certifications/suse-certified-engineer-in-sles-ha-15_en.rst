And I'm back at 100% SUSE Certified :D I took the Exam on the first day of SUSECON 24 in Berlin.
Glad that I passed, couple of tricky questions, but fair for an advanced level cert.
I can see why Richard Mayne is proud of the Exam questions he wrote :)

Now I have to wait till the SUSE Training Team releases a new Exam.
I've heard something about `Longhorn <https://longhorn.io>`_ during SUSECON, let's wait and see.

**Summary**:

Demonstrates knowledge of how to deploy workloads along with performing maintenance
tasks and upgrading the cluster software on an existing HA cluster.
