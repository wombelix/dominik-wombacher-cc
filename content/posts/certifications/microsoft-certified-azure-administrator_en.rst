Next step on my Cloud Journey completed by passing the AZ-104 Exam, it was a tough one but still fair and 
a great basis to build further Azure knowledge on top. It's also a mandatory pre-requirement to 
become a Azure Solution Architect, which is on my bucket list for end of August / begin of September.

Similar as for `AZ-900 <{filename}/posts/certifications/microsoft-certified-azure-fundamentals_en.rst>`_, 
there are a lot of great and mostly even free resources out their to prepare for AZ-104, my favorites:

- `Microsoft Learning, AZ-104 Exam Overview <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104>`_, 
  Scroll down to *"Items in this collection"* to access the related learning paths.

- `John Savill's Technical Training, AZ-104 Certification Course <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlVtbbG169nGlGPWs9xaLKT1KfwqREHbs>`_

And if your Employer is part of the `Microsoft Enterprise Skills Initiative <https://esi.microsoft.com>`_, 
you can book a 4-days online course, delivered by Microsoft, for free and don't forget to use the offered 
Practice Exams as final step before taking the actual exam.

It's also important to get some Hands-On experience if you not already working with Azure on a regular basis, 
otherwise it's hard to pass questions about CLI or PowerShell commands, necessary steps and order that need to 
be performed to achieve a specific result or fill in blanks in ARM Templates and other interesting type of questions. 

The Microsoft Course includes access to a Lab Environment, all labs are published on 
`Github <https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/>`_ if you wanna run 
them in your own Azure Subscription.

And last but not least, learn about Azure Network as much as you can, it's a large part of the Exam 
and getting those Questions right will make the difference between passing and failing.

**Summary**: Earning Azure Administrator Associate certification validates the skills and knowledge to implement, 
manage, and monitor an organizationâ€™s Microsoft Azure environment. Candidates have a deep understanding of each implementing, 
managing, and monitoring identity, governance, storage, compute, and virtual networks in a cloud environment, plus provision, 
size, monitor, and adjust resources, when needed.
