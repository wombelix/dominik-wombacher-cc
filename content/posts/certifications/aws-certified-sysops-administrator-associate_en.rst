I completed the AWS Associate Trifecta by passing the third Exam and becoming an
**AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate** today. I'm very proud about
getting all three Associate Certifications within one month, preparing for them
boosted my AWS knowledge and provides massive value in my job.

Again I just kept it simple, focused on Hands-On Labs from
`A Cloud Guru <https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-8Lkj>`_ and the
`eBook <https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/tutorials-dojo-study-guide-ebook-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/>`_
as well as `Practice Exam <https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate-practice-exams/>`_
from Tutorials Dojo. The content overlap between the Solutions Architect, Developer Exam and SysOps Administrator is quite large,
I guess it's around 60%, also a lot of questions can be answered with common IT knowledge and understanding,
I recommend to not overthinking it, trust you and your experience, focus on topics you have some gaps and just go for it.

Summary
*********
