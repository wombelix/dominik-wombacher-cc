Next step in my continuous learning path was to achieve the SPSA SLES, which I did today. 

It was a great opportunity to strengthen my knowledge about troubleshooting, how to make the most out of provided tools and best practices to interact with the SUSE Support Team.

In my opinion every Engineer who's going to Support SLES Server should attend to the Course behind the SPSA Certification. 

Unfortunately SUSE only offers it as part of their Partner Program, but most of the Content is public available. 

An Overview of the Course Content, where to find further information and some examples will be part of a separate Blog Post that I'm going to publish soon.
