After a few weeks of preparation I've passed the **AWS Devops Engineer Professional** Exam.
I enjoyed most of the studying. There were just a couple of topics that
are a bit dry and harder to go through. Overall it was interesting and valuable
to dive deep into AWS services and tooling around DevOps. Quite obvious that
serverless technologies like Lambda or DynamoDB and AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild,
CodeDeploy and the like have a strong focus in the Exam.

Similar as for the Associate Exams, I used the Practice Exam and eBook from `Tutorials Dojo <https://www.tutorialsdojo.com>`_
to study and prepare. For me that was all I needed, I found other courses too time consuming given that I already have a lot of AWS knowledge.

As always, studying for the exam helped me to get new architecture and integration ideas.
For example NeuVector by SUSE and AWS CodePipeline, stay tuned, I will share something soon ;)
