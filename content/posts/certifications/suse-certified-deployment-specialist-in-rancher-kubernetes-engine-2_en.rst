Second day at SUSECON 23 in Munich, second Exam passed: **SCDS in Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2**.
After passing `SCA in NeuVector 5 <{filename}/posts/certifications/suse-certified-administrator-in-suse-neuvector-5_en.rst>`_
yesterday, I can remove another one from my list. Let's see if I can also clear
*SCDS in Rancher Manager 2.7 for Rancher Prime* tomorrow.

**Summary**: Thorough understanding in deploying, backing up, restoring, and upgrading Kubernetes clusters with RKE2
in a professional setting.
