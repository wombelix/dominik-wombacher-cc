I have the pleasure to work even more with SUSE Products in future, therefore I wanted 
to brush up my knowledge about SUSE Linux Enterprise Server High Availability a bit. 

Today I passed the related Exam with a great Score of 97% and received the Certification 
**SCA+ in SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability 12** and 
**SCA+ in SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability 15**.

**Summary**: The "SCA+ in SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability" certification is an additional option for administrators 
and focuses on the functionality and features provided by SUSE Linux Enterprise HA. It also covers how to plan, 
deploy and administer the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability product on premise and the public cloud.
