After passing the RHCSA and RHCE Exam already a few weeks ago, I also completed the Red Hat Exam *EX447* today and earned the **Red Hat Certified Specialist in Advanced Automation: Ansible Best Practices** Certification.

It was the next logical Step to finish the Ansible Track before moving on to other Specialist Exams on my way to become a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) one day ;).

Compared to the RHCE with a more or less 100% Ansible focus, EX447 was roughly 50% Ansible in more depth and 50% Ansible Tower.

I'm using AWX, the Tower Upstream Project, for quite some time already, I think that expirience helped a lot.

**Summary**: A Red Hat Certified Specialist in Advanced Automation: Ansible Best Practices is able to automate management of large or complex networks of machines. He demonstrate mastery of Ansible, knowledge of Ansible Tower and an understanding of Ansible best practices.
