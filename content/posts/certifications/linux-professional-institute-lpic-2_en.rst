Today was finally the day I passed the second Exam **202-450** and became **LPIC-2** certified. 
I passed the first Exam, *201-450* already in October 2019, but failed the second one. 

Then life happened, other personal and professional priorities, finishing the LPIC-2 was long time 
on my list but I never actually did it. Last year on Cyber Monday I bought the Voucher to "force" 
me to get it done this year. 

I was on vacation for two weeks and used some of this time to prepare for the Exam, which was even 
harder as I remembered it, and passed this time with a decent score. The resources I used to Study:

- `The LPIC2 Exam Prep <https://lpic2book.github.io/src/>`_ (open source)

- `LPIC-2 Study Guide <https://www.wiley.com/en-us/LPIC+2%3A+Linux+Professional+Institute+Certification+Study+Guide%3A+Exam+201+and+Exam+202%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119150794>`_ (Wiley / Sybex, ISBN: 978-1-119-15079-4)

- `Cert Guide LPIC-2 <https://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/lpic-2-cert-guide-201-400-and-202-400-exams-9780789757142>`_ (Pearson IT Certification, ISBN-13: 978-0-7897-5714-2))

They are all good in their own way and teach a lot about the different topics, but without 
reading through man pages and official docs, by memorizing CLI tools and parameter as well as 
the syntax of all the involved config files, in addition to those books, it's not possible to pass. 

The Exam Questions are hard and mostly very in-depth what they are asking and expect you to know.

When I started to Study, people asked me why, I already have a lot of Linux related 
certifications and many years of experience. First it was something I started years ago and didn't 
finished, which felt wrong. Second, it's now a container and cloud world out there, but "classic" 
Linux administrator knowledge, like Bind, LDAP, Samba, Postfix or Dovecot, is still valuable. 

Preparing for the Exam helped me to brush up my knowledge, I didn't used some of the tools in years, 
but it was great to build and configure something without automation or containers. I'm sure I can 
reuse a lot of these knowledge and transfer it into "the new world" as well.

**Summary**: The LPIC-2 validates the candidate’s ability to administer small to medium–sized mixed networks.
