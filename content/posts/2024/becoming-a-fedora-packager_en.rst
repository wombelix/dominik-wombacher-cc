I recently decided to finally become an active package maintainer.
Quickly I had to realize that there are different ways to become a Fedora Packager.
All have in common that, what a surprise, you maintain or co-maintain a package.

But, from all options, the most "classic" way seem to:

1. Create a package
2. Submit a Review Request
3. When it's approved ask for a Sponsor
4. Get sponsored into the packager group
5. Publish your first package

The Fedora project has tons of documentation.
I found it on the one hand great as a greenhorn to find all these information.
And at the same time it was overwhelming and sometimes unclear which is current.

So I put together a short list with resources that helped me most.
They are not necessary in a logical order.
They will also not cover each and every question you might have.
But you can use them as a starting point.

- `New Package Process for New Contributors <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/New_Package_Process_for_New_Contributors/>`_

- `Installing Packager Tools <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Installing_Packager_Tools/>`_

- `Packaging Tutorial 2: GNU Hello <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Packaging_Tutorial_2_GNU_Hello/>`_

- `Joining the Package Maintainers <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Joining_the_Package_Maintainers/>`_

- `Package Maintainers > Package Maintenance Guide > Using fedpkg anonymously <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Package_Maintenance_Guide/#using_fedpkg_anonymously>`_

- `Packaging Guidelines > RPM Macros <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/RPMMacros/>`_

- `Fedora Packaging Guidelines <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/>`_

- `Packaging Guidelines > Users and Groups > Dynamic allocation <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/UsersAndGroups/#_dynamic_allocation>`_

*What if you still have question?*

Don't be shy, write to the `devel mailing list <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/>`_ and or join the `Fedora Devel Matrix room <https://matrix.to/#/#devel:fedoraproject.org>`_!

After many many years in the industry, a lot of touch points
and contributions to open source projects, I finally made the jump
to become a package maintainer.

I learned so much in the last month and went from zero to ~15 Fedora and EPEL packages
I became responsible for. This feels like a great success and a valuable way to give
something back to the community.
