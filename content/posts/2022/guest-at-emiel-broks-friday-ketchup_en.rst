During the SUSE Sales Summit 2022 in Malta this week, I finally had the chance to meet Emiel in person. 
I'm a huge fan of his `Friday Ketchup <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNhbL1-og4Q&list=PLB-EQNAXFCc9pByWazAKct05QYztYbFFd>`_ 
and had the pleasure to be his guest!

I have to admit that I was a little nervous and that we jumped right into it, a little unprepared 
and after three long days without much sleep, didn't made it better, but I think we still rocked it ;)

We talked about the song I picked as intro / outro, my job as Sr. Partner Solutions Architect for SUSE at AWS, 
my passion about open source and my personal view on the Partnership between AWS and SUSE.

You can find it on YouTube: `Friday Ketchup Powerful Partnership with AWS <https://youtu.be/6R3RZ57LX9o>`_
