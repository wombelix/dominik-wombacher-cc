I don't have much time anymore to play games, probably a reason why I love gamification, 
that's something that raise the chances that I continuously invest time in something.

I'm looking for different ways to improve my AWS skills and found `AWS Cloud Quest <https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/>`_, 
an open world role-playing game that teaches you how to build real-world AWS solutions using cloud concepts and exercises.

The **Cloud Practitioner** Role can be played for free, I did that already a few months ago as part of my 
`AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner <{filename}/posts/certifications/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner_en.rst>`_ Exam prep, 
I loved the experience and think it really helped me to pass the Exam and strengthen my AWS knowledge. So I used 
AWS Cloud Quest again, this time I played the **Solutions Architect**, as one of the resources to prepare for my 
upcoming AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam.

I like the way how the game is designed and guides you through a lot of different assignments and challenges you have to solve. 
Just take a look and give it a try if you like some gamification and fun way of learning :) You can also earn nice Credly Badges!

I've got `AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner <https://www.credly.com/badges/3d17c073-27ae-476a-bfb5-088b540061d7>`__

But at least the Roles **Serverless Developer** and **Security** are still on my bucket list!
