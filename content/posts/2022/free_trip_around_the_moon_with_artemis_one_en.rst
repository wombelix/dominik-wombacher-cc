Be part of the Artemis Mission and send your Name on a Flash Drive around the Moon.

Artemis I will be the first (uncrewed) flight test and just the begin to build a long-term human presence at the Moon.

I think that's actually exciting to see and be a (small) part of it,

And ignore the fact that one Artemis Mission costs $4.1 billion, given that fact it might be 
just a matter of time until SpaceX comes into play and does it for half the price ;)
