I'm impacted by the recent AWS layoffs. Monday, July 28th, 2025 will
be my last day after almost 3 years as a Senior Partner Solutions
Architect.

During my time at AWS, I worked with SUSE, Red Hat, and Canonical on
joint opportunities, built open-source integrations, and spoke at
industry conferences like KubeCon and SUSECON. I'm grateful for the
people I had the pleasure to work with and the technical problems we
solved together.

Now I'm looking for my next role. Some of the projects I've worked on
recently - from AWS Neuron kernel module tooling to Fedora packaging
of AWS C libraries - follow my typical workflow: identify the problem,
build the solution, automate the process, and share the results with
the community.

For details about what I'm looking for and my background, check my
`resume <{filename}/pages/resume_en.rst>`__ and
