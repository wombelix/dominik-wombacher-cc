I'm using a lot of Open Source Software and always benefited from the work of the community. 
So whenever possible I try to contribute and give something back.

As mentioned in other Posts, I'm using SUSE Manager at work, the commercial Product of the Upstream 
Open Source Project `Uyuni <https://www.uyuni-project.org>`_, which is a fork of `Spacewalk <https://spacewalkproject.github.io>`_ 
that `SUSE introduced 2018 <https://www.suse.com/c/were-back-to-earth-and-the-earth-is-flat-welcome-uyuni/>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20200421061926/https://www.suse.com/c/were-back-to-earth-and-the-earth-is-flat-welcome-uyuni/>`__,

So I decided it's time to look for a `good-first-issue <https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/labels/good%20first%20issue>`_ 
and support the Uyuni Project as well. I'm still improving my Java Skills, 
so I thought some adjustments on the `Setup Bash Script <https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/issues/1354>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20210324212349/https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/issues/1354>`__,
`[2] <https://archive.today/2021.03.24-212400/https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/issues/1354>`__) 
might be the right thing to start with.

The Task was to get the product name from a default config file and use this value 
instead the hardcoded occurrences of **SUSE Manager** for user visible output. 

Today my `pull request <https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/3460>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20210324212223/https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/3460>`__,
`[2] <https://archive.today/2021.03.24-212223/https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/pull/3460>`__) 
was accepted and merged in the Main branch :)
