The read-more Pelican Plugin was the second one I helped to migrate to the `new Structure / GitHub Organization <https://github.com/pelican-plugins>`_.

After a specified length, it adds a *"read more"* link the the Posts Overview, you can see it on this Blog in action for example.

The Configuration is very easy, the Plugin supports a few Parameter for your pelican.conf File.

It can by installed by running :code:`python -m pip install pelican-read-more`, the Source is available on https://github.com/pelican-plugins/read-more
