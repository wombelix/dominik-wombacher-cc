A few years ago I setup my personal site based on Wordpress and was quite happy with that. 
But after some time I wasn't sure anymore if this is really what I want:

- First of all I had to take care about updates every few weeks and had always a bad feeling about potential security issues. 

- Also the Content I added couldn't easy be converted in other Formats neither the Source Code shared without Plugins.

- And last but not least, a few Megabyte had to be transfered, multiple Cookies were set and lot of Javascript loaded to read just a short post.

I started looking around and liked the approach to use a static site generator and focus on pure HTML as well CSS.

After some research and testing i decided to go with `Pelican <https://www.getpelican.com>`_, it's Python based and can be 
extended by `Plugins <https://github.com/pelican-plugins/>`_.

So I started to:

- Creating a own Theme

- Contribute to update and migrate `old Plugins <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes>`_ I like to use 

- Migrate content, split across various locations, to reStructuredText

Not finished yet, but as you can see, there were already some progress :)

I plan to publish my Theme shortly as well invest more time in Contributing to the Pelican Project.
