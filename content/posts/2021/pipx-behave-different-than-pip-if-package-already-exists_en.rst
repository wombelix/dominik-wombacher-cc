I decided to put as much as possible of my local config into an Ansible Playbook. 
Makes it easier to track what I install and change, also to setup from scratch should it necessary.

In the past I mainly used `pip` in combination with `venv` to install Python stuff. 
Changing for most of it to `pipx` seems logical, it will take care about the necessary *venvs* on it's own.

Just had to learn that the return code of `pip` is **0** but from `pipx` it's **1** in case a package already exists. 

Why does it matter? Not the most elegant solution but I decided to just use `command` to trigger *pip* / *pipx* from my Playbook:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Python Package Installation (pip)
    command: "python3 -m pip install --user {{ item }}"
    changed_when: false
    loop:
      - pipx
      - nox

  - name: Python Package Installation (pipx)
    command: "pipx install {{ item }}"
    changed_when: false
    loop:
      - poetry
      - duplicity
      - pre-commit

No problem with `pip`, but `pipx` failed after the first run.

There was an older `GitHub Issue <https://github.com/pypa/pipx/issues/125>`_, based on the comments, 
`pipx` was supposed to behave smilar as `pip` and also use return code 0 since v0.13 already. 
After some research I found the `Pull Request <https://github.com/pypa/pipx/pull/560>`_ 
that reverted the earlier change during some re-factoring.

Thanks to the great improvements in that PR, it was just a very small change necessary to restore the 
functionality introduced in `Commit 11b853e <https://github.com/pypa/pipx/commit/11b853e9c6926b32133b27822516b2a5b4f35411>`_:

Merged into `pipx/main` on 25th September 2021

That's a good example why I love and prefer Open Source, I could fix the Problem on my own and share the improvement with the community, within a few days it was already merged and will be part of the next Release.
