Just a quick one, Rocky Linux, some sort of the successor of CentOS - at least from a Community perspective - published RC1 of Version 8.3: https://rockylinux.org/news/rocky-linux-8-3-rc1-release/

Quote from www.rockylinux.org::

> Rocky Linux is a community enterprise operating system designed to be 
> 100% bug-for-bug compatible with America's top enterprise Linux

> It is under intensive development by the community. 
> Rocky Linux is led by Gregory Kurtzer, founder of the CentOS project. 

I didn't had a chance to install the RC yet, but I follow the development since a while and I'm impressed how the Rocky Linux Community setup the whole Project and Infrastructure within a few months. It feels like that Rocky will be the new CentOS, even though there are other Enterprise Linux Clones / Derivates, they have mostly a commercial background and are not fully community driven.
