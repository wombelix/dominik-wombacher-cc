As already mentioned in my Post `Migration from Wordpress to Pelican <{filename}migration-from-wordpress-to-pelican_en.rst>`_ 
the fact that Pelican is written in Python and provide a Plugin system was important for me. So I can adjust the Code and also give 
something back to the `Pelican Community <https://www.getpelican.com>`_

The Project is moving away from their `monolithic Plugin Repository <https://www.github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins>`_ to a 
separate `Organization Namespace <https://www.github.com/pelican-plugins/>`_ were every Plugin has it's own Repository and 
get published to `PyPI <https://www.pypi.org>`_.

Due to the fact that i wanted to use the `PDF Generator <https://www.github.com/pelican-plugins/pdf>`_ but it wasn't yet migrated, 
i decided to `contribute <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/issues/1328>`__ 
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20210303101921/https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/issues/1328>`__,
`[2] <https://archive.today/2021.03.03-101922/https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/issues/1328>`__)
and assist with updating and migrating this Plugin.

Today I proudly present: `My first accepted Pull Request for Pelican (PDF Plugin) <https://github.com/pelican-plugins/pdf/pull/1>`__
(Archive: `[1] <https://web.archive.org/web/20210303100907/https://github.com/pelican-plugins/pdf/pull/1>`__,
`[2] <https://archive.today/2021.03.03-100750/https://github.com/pelican-plugins/pdf/pull/1>`__)

There is still room for improvement and i'm working on further fixes and features, but it's a starting Point.

You find at the bottom of every Article and Page a PDF Download Link, the linked PDF file was generated by the mentioned Plugin.
