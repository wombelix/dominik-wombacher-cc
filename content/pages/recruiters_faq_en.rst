You're a Recruiter? Then this FAQ is for you to make things easier for both of us.

Why?
====

I have nothing against receiving offers and talking about opportunities,
but it's getting more difficult and time consuming to answer all requests.

Especially messages like *"I have multiple job opportunities"* or
*"if you are interested please share your resume"* barely get my attention to be frank.

----

Are you interested in changing your job?
========================================

**Immediately**, I am actively applying.

----

How should the first message from a recruiter look like?
========================================================

As much details and context as possible, for example:

- A description of the position
- The project or company
- Used technologies
- Salary range
- Remote work policy
- Contract type

----

What Positions are you looking for?
===================================

I'm seeking **hands-on engineering roles** where I can **write code daily**, **solve complex technical problems**,
and **work across infrastructure and application layers**.

Specifically, I'm interested in roles such as:

- **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**
- **Platform Engineer**
- **DevOps Engineer**
- **Cloud Engineer**
- **Software Engineer** (infrastructure/platform focus)

I'm open to **Senior, Staff, or Principal-level positions** depending on the role scope and organization.
What matters most is **hands-on technical work** rather than seniority title.

**Solutions Architect** or **Field Engineer** roles can work if they involve significant **technical implementation
and coding** rather than primarily presentations and sales support.

I'm **exclusively** interested in opportunities as **Individual Contributor**.
I am **not** considering management roles at this time.

----

What Positions are you **not** looking for?
===========================================

I'm **not** looking for roles **without significant hands-on technical involvement**, such as:

- **Management** or **People Management** positions
- **Pre-Sales**, **Sales Engineering**, or **Go-to-Market** roles
- **Account Management**, **Business Development**, or **Customer Success** positions
- **Project Management** or **Vendor Management** without technical implementation
- **Solution Architecture** roles focused primarily on **presentations and sales support**
- Any role where the primary focus is **business development** rather than **technical engineering**

I prefer **building and implementing solutions** over **presenting and selling them**.

----

What makes a role appealing to me?
==================================

I'm looking for roles where I can:

- **Write code daily** - Python, Go, TypeScript, or similar languages
- **Build and maintain infrastructure** - Kubernetes, cloud platforms, automation tooling
- **Troubleshoot complex technical problems** - from network packets to application code
- **Design and implement systems** - not just presentations, but hands-on building
- **Automate processes** - eliminate manual work, improve reliability
- **Work across the full stack** - infrastructure, systems, and code
- **Contribute to open source** - build in the open when possible
- **Mentor through code** - reviews, pair programming, technical guidance

I work best in environments that value **solving hard technical problems** over
**sales presentations and business development**.

**Note**: I'm transitioning from a Solution Architect role back to **hands-on engineering**.
I want to spend my time **building and coding**, not presenting and selling.

----

What contract types do you consider?
====================================

**Full-Time permanent contract**.

----

Would you relocate for a new job?
=================================

**No**, I'm **only** interested to work **remote** with **0% - 10% traveling**.

----

Can you send me your CV / resume?
=================================

**No**, you already have all information you need.

My personal website contains the latest version of my
`Resume <{filename}/pages/resume_en.rst>`_, which I keep in sync with my
`LinkedIn Profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-wombacher/>`_.

----

Can I contact you if my offer does not include remote work?
===========================================================

Sure, but most likely I'm not much interested if remote work isn't possible at all or at least most of the time.

----

Can I contact you if I can not provide any details about the offer?
===================================================================

Sure, but in that case responding will probably not have the highest priority for me.

----

Do you hate recruiters?
=======================

No, everyone has a job. Yours is to fill positions with the right people.
But you are not alone, there are many out there.

That's why I appreciate when you follow some basic rules when you reach out.
