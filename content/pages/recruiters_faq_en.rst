Why?
====

I have nothing against receiving offers and talking about opportunities,
but it's getting more difficult and time consuming to answer all requests.

Especially messages like *"I have multiple job opportunities"* or
*"if you are interested please share your resume"* barely get my attention to be frank.

You are a Recruiter? Then this FAQ is for you to make things easier for both of us.

----

How should the first message from a recruiter look like?
========================================================

As much details and context as possible, for example:

- A description of the position
- The project or company
- Used technologies
- Salary range
- Remote work policy
- Contract type

----

Are you interested changing your job?
=====================================

**Yes**, I'm Open to Work and actively applying.

----

Which Positions are you looking for?
====================================

I want to go back to my **Engineering** roots and looking for a new opportunity as:

- **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**
- **System Development Engineer**
- **Dev Ops Engineer**
- **Platform Engineer**

I'm interested in **Senior**, **Principal** and **Staff** Roles and willing to **Lead an Engineering Team**. 
As long I can **stay hands-on** and **actively involved** in the daily business and technical doing.

----

What Positions are you **not** looking for?
===========================================

I'm **not** looking for non-technical Management or Architecture positions with a pure Business or Sales focus.

----

What contract types do you consider?
====================================

Currently only **Full-Time permanent contract**.

----

Would you relocate for a new job?
=================================

**No**, I'm only interested to work remote with 0% - 10% traveling.

----

Can you send me your CV / resume?
=================================

**No**, you already have all information you need.

My personal website always contains the latest version of my
`Resume <{filename}/pages/resume_en.rst>`_, which I keep in sync with my
`LinkedIn Profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-wombacher/>`_.

So, feel free to get yourself what you need.

----

Can I contact you if my offer does not include remote work?
===========================================================

Sure, but most likely I'm not much interested if remote work isn't possible at all or at least most of the time.

----

Can I contact you if I can not provide any details about the offer?
===================================================================

Sure, but in that case responding will probably not have the highest priority for me.

----

Do you hate recruiters?
=======================

No, everyone has a job, your's is it to fill positions with the right people.
But you are not alone, there are lot out there.
Thats why I appreciate when you follow some basic rules when you reach out.
