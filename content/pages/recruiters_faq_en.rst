You're a Recruiter? Then this FAQ is for you to make things easier for both of us.

Why?
====

I have nothing against receiving offers and talking about opportunities,
but it's getting more difficult and time consuming to answer all requests.

Especially messages like *"I have multiple job opportunities"* or
*"if you are interested please share your resume"* barely get my attention to be frank.

----

Are you interested changing your job?
=====================================

**Immediately**, I am actively applying.

----

How should the first message from a recruiter look like?
========================================================

As much details and context as possible, for example:

- A description of the position
- The project or company
- Used technologies
- Salary range
- Remote work policy
- Contract type

----

What Positions are you looking for?
===================================

I'm seeking **Principal, Staff, or other senior-level Positions** that offer a healthy **hands-on** portion and
**active involvement** in the **daily technical doing** and **solution design**.

Roles such as **Solutions Architect**, **Cloud Architect**, **AWS Architect**, **DevOps Engineer**,
**Cloud Engineer**, **Platform Engineer**, **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**, **Technical Lead**,
or **Lead Engineer** can be a good fit, depending on the individual job description.

I'm mainly interested in opportunities as **Individual Contributor**.
I consider a Role as **Manager** only when I can **Lead an Engineering Team**.

----

What Positions are you **not** looking for?
===========================================

I'm **not** looking for roles **without significant technical involvement**, such as
**Management**, **Account Management**, or **Business Development** positions.

I'm also not interested in roles that are primarily **project management**
or **vendor management** without hands-on technical involvement.

----

What contract types do you consider?
====================================

**Full-Time permanent contract**.

----

Would you relocate for a new job?
=================================

**No**, I'm **only** interested to work **remote** with **0% - 10% traveling**.

----

Can you send me your CV / resume?
=================================

**No**, you already have all information you need.

My personal website contains the latest version of my
`Resume <{filename}/pages/resume_en.rst>`_, which I keep in sync with my
`LinkedIn Profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-wombacher/>`_.

----

Can I contact you if my offer does not include remote work?
===========================================================

Sure, but most likely I'm not much interested if remote work isn't possible at all or at least most of the time.

----

Can I contact you if I can not provide any details about the offer?
===================================================================

Sure, but in that case responding will probably not have the highest priority for me.

----

Do you hate recruiters?
=======================

No, everyone has a job, yours is it to fill positions with the right people.
But you are not alone, there are lot out there.

Thats why I appreciate when you follow some basic rules when you reach out.
