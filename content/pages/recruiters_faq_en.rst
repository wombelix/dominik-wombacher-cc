You're a Recruiter? Then this FAQ is for you to make things easier for both of us.

Why?
====

I have nothing against receiving offers and talking about opportunities,
but it's getting more difficult and time consuming to answer all requests.

Especially messages like *"I have multiple job opportunities"* or
*"if you are interested please share your resume"* barely get my attention to be frank.

----

Are you interested changing your job?
=====================================

**Immediately**, I am actively applying.

----

How should the first message from a recruiter look like?
========================================================

As much details and context as possible, for example:

- A description of the position
- The project or company
- Used technologies
- Salary range
- Remote work policy
- Contract type

----

What Positions are you looking for?
===================================

I'm seeking **Principal, Staff, and Distinguished-level Engineering Positions** that offer **deep hands-on technical work**
and **active involvement** in **coding, system design, and technical implementation**.

Specifically, I'm interested in roles such as:

- **Principal Engineer**
- **Distinguished Engineer**
- **Staff Engineer**
- **Senior Staff Engineer**
- **Lead Engineer**

Other roles like **DevOps Engineer**, **Cloud Engineer**, **Platform Engineer**, or **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**
can also be a good fit at **Principal/Staff level** or equivalent seniority.

**Solutions Architect** roles can work if they involve significant **hands-on technical implementation**
rather than primarily presentations and sales support.

I'm **exclusively** interested in opportunities as **Individual Contributor**.
I am **not** considering management roles at this time.

----

What Positions are you **not** looking for?
===========================================

I'm **not** looking for roles **without significant hands-on technical involvement**, such as:

- **Management** or **People Management** positions
- **Pre-Sales**, **Sales Engineering**, or **Go-to-Market** roles
- **Account Management**, **Business Development**, or **Customer Success** positions
- **Project Management** or **Vendor Management** without technical implementation
- **Solution Architecture** roles focused primarily on **presentations and sales support**
- Any role where the primary focus is **business development** rather than **technical engineering**

I prefer **building and implementing solutions** over **presenting and selling them**.

----

What makes a role appealing to me?
==================================

I'm looking for roles where I can:

- **Write code** and **implement technical solutions** on a regular basis
- **Design system architectures** and **make technical decisions**
- **Troubleshoot complex technical problems** and **debug systems**
- **Work with cutting-edge technologies** and **contribute to open source projects**
- **Mentor other engineers** through **technical guidance** rather than management
- **Automate processes** and **optimize system performance**

I work best in environments that value **technical depth** over **business presentations**.

**Note**: While I'm currently in a Solution Architect role, I'm actively seeking to transition
back to **hands-on engineering positions** where I can focus on **technical implementation**
rather than sales and go-to-market activities.

----

What contract types do you consider?
====================================

**Full-Time permanent contract**.

----

Would you relocate for a new job?
=================================

**No**, I'm **only** interested to work **remote** with **0% - 10% traveling**.

----

Can you send me your CV / resume?
=================================

**No**, you already have all information you need.

My personal website contains the latest version of my
`Resume <{filename}/pages/resume_en.rst>`_, which I keep in sync with my
`LinkedIn Profile <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-wombacher/>`_.

----

Can I contact you if my offer does not include remote work?
===========================================================

Sure, but most likely I'm not much interested if remote work isn't possible at all or at least most of the time.

----

Can I contact you if I can not provide any details about the offer?
===================================================================

Sure, but in that case responding will probably not have the highest priority for me.

----

Do you hate recruiters?
=======================

No, everyone has a job, yours is it to fill positions with the right people.
But you are not alone, there are lot out there.

Thats why I appreciate when you follow some basic rules when you reach out.
