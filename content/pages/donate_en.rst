I'm a passionate technology generalist, Open Source contributor,
a Lovely Geek & Tinkerer with 20+ years of experience.
I build tools and solutions around Linux, Kubernetes, cloud native
and automation. Your donation helps keep this work going.
I've worked in tech since 2002, focusing on solving hard problems
with open source tools. My work centers on Linux, Kubernetes,
cloud native infrastructure, and automation. I write code, build
platforms, and share what I learn with the community.
Your sponsorship helps sustain this work. Open source takes time
and energy. Financial support means I can dedicate more hours to
projects, improvements, and community contributions without
worrying about covering the costs.
