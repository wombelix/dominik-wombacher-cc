About me
========

To be at my best, **I need complex technical problems and challenges**
where I can bring in my **20+ years of experience as a technology generalist**.
I'm an **Open Source Enthusiast and Contributor**. A **Passionate Engineer**
with a strong **hands-on mentality**. A **problem solver**, **experienced Architect**
and **People Manager**. A **Leader** who takes **Ownership** and is always eager to
**learn and adapt**. **My core strength** is the ability to **work equally at strategic and operational levels**.
**Seamlessly transitioning from** **big-picture strategy** down to **technical implementation** details.

My **professional career started in 2002** and has always been **IT focused**.
I have a strong background in **Architecture, Engineering and Operations**.
**Adopting new Technologies** and **DevOps and DevSecOps paradigms** as well as **Automation**,
**Programming** and **Mentorship** are an integral part of my work.

I'm passionate about **Linux**, **Kubernetes**, **Cloud Native Infrastructure**,
**Platform Engineering**, **Coding** and **Automation**.
I know **multiple programming languages** and **dive deep into a new codebase quickly**.
I systematically **troubleshoot issues and debug code** and prefer to **automate re-occurring tasks**.
I'm a **generalist** with a very **broad skill set**. I would describe myself as an
**expert engineer** and **intermediate software developer**.

**Learning and Development** is important for me, **technical trainings and certifications**
allow me to **improve and validate my skills**. In recent years, I have earned **18x SUSE**,
**7x AWS**, **3x Kubernetes**, **5x Red Hat**, **2x Linux**, **2x Azure** and **5x SAP certified**.
With a **track record** of **more than 70 technical certifications** throughout my career.
